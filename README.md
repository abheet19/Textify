*Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using T5-Large AI and modern web technologies*
   ```

---

## . Detailed Theory

Under the hood, this system uses an extractive summarization technique. Key highlights:
- Uses the ‚ÄúSummarizer‚Äù library, leveraging a pretrained BERT model to rank sentences based on contextual embeddings.
- Extractive, rather than abstractive, meaning it picks crucial sentences from the original text rather than paraphrasing.
- Word cloud generation: Generates a visual representation of term frequencies in the processed text.

---

## . Usage Workflow

1. Upload a file under ‚ÄúUpload Document for Summarization‚Äù or provide a URL link in ‚ÄúSummarization by scraping a URL link content‚Äù.
2. Once the text is processed, you can see the summary and optionally download a DOCX file containing the summary and word cloud.

---

## . Additional Configuration & Deployment

- Adjust environment variables in `.env` or `config.py` to set secret keys, debug modes, etc.
- Containerize the application (e.g., using Docker) for consistent deployment across environments.
- Deploy to a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.) by following their specific instructions. Ensure you configure all environment variables and port mappings properly.
